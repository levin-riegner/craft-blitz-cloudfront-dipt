- Added purging of asset image URLs and existing image transforms when image dimensions or focal points are changed.
- Added a `purgeAssetImagesWhenChanged` config setting that determines whether asset images should be purged when changed.
- Added a tip about excluding the cache folder path from search engine indexing to the Blitz File Storage settings.

### Changed
- Cookies are now removed from cached responses as they can prevent edge-side caching.

## 4.3.1 - 2023-02-10
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in which saving elements without going through a draft were not triggering cache refreshes ([#474](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-blitz/issues/474)).
